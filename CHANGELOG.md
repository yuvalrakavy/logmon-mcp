# Changelog

Notable changes per release. Versions are `0.x`, so the MINOR component carries
anything behaviour-visible; PATCH is reserved for fixes nobody has to know about.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-29

`PROTOCOL_VERSION` stays at **1**. Everything here is additive on the wire —
new methods, new fields on existing results — and the handshake compares the
protocol version for exact equality, so bumping it would refuse every client
that had not been upgraded in lockstep. An 0.3.0 `logmon-mcp` shim talks to an
0.4.0 broker without noticing; it just won't offer the new tools.

### Added

- **Span time collectors.** Arm a filter, run a workload, read aggregate
  timings — the measurement logmon could not do before, when the only way to
  answer "did that change make it faster" was to eyeball individual traces.

  `add_collector` / `list_collectors` / `get_collector` / `reset_collector` /
  `remove_collector`, plus `profile_traces` for the same numbers over spans
  already in the buffer. Mirrored to the CLI as `logmon-mcp collectors …`.

  Three retention levels trade memory for what can be asked: `scalar` (counts
  and totals, no per-span records), `timing` (adds percentiles, wall-clock
  union, warm-up exclusion), `tree` (adds self time, nesting detection and
  call paths). `group_keys` splits every number by a span attribute, which is
  how both arms of an A/B run in one pass — and it reads attribute values
  directly, so a boolean kill-switch works, which it does not on the filter
  path.

  A result reports three categories that are **not** three views of one
  number: `exact` covers every matched span for the collector's life,
  `estimated` covers the same population to ±1% via a sketch, and `sampled` is
  exact over retained records — the whole population only while `complete` is
  true. Anything that cannot be computed is `null` with a named reason and
  usually a remedy, because `null` and `0` are different claims.

  Self time uses a clipped interval union, not a sum of children. A 100 ms
  parent with two concurrent 60 ms children has 40 ms of self time; summing
  gives −20, and clamping that to zero reports a parent that did no work of
  its own — on exactly the `tokio::spawn` workload the feature exists to
  measure.

  Cost, measured: about 0.21 µs per armed collector against a 4.10 µs ingest
  baseline, or 20% at the four-collector reservation ceiling.

- **Span loss is now counted.** `ReceiverMetrics` gained per-transport counters
  for whole batches shed under backpressure and for spans rejected at parse.
  Neither was visible before: HTTP sheds whole request bodies at 80% channel
  occupancy and returns 429 *before* parsing anything, so no per-span counter
  moved; malformed spans bumped a gRPC field nothing read, and on HTTP were not
  counted at all. A collector reports these as a window delta so a run can say
  whether it lost spans while it was measuring.

### Fixed

- **`get_slow_spans(group_by="name")` aggregated a doubly-biased sample.** It
  grouped the output of the slow-span query, which filters by a duration floor
  and then truncates to `count` — so `avg_ms` was the mean of the slowest few
  above a floor, presented as the mean for that span name. A name that ran
  10 ms a hundred times and 500 ms three times reported 500.

  It now aggregates the full matching population, and `min_duration_ms` is a
  display floor selecting which *names* appear rather than which spans count.
  New `population`, `display_floor_ms`, per-row `max_ms` and `p50_ms` make the
  basis visible: a low `avg_ms` beside a high `max_ms` means "usually fast,
  with a tail", which the old shape could not express. `p95_ms` also follows
  the lower-quantile convention — the previous `floor(n × 0.95)` returned the
  maximum at n = 20. The ungrouped arm is unchanged: a list of the slowest
  spans is not an aggregate, and truncating it is what it is for.

- **Span triggers re-parsed their filter for every span.** Evaluation went
  through the filter *string*, so each bound session re-parsed — and
  recompiled the seeded regex — once per span. Per-span ingest cost at four
  bound sessions was 118.6 µs; it is now 4.66 µs, and nearly flat in session
  count rather than linear.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- **A trigger firing no longer blinds the other triggers in its session.** The
  post-window was a single counter on the session, and the log processor skipped
  evaluating that whole session while it was positive. For `post_window` entries
  (200 by default) after ANY trigger matched, NO trigger in that session was
  evaluated — a session-wide duty cycle of at most one firing per 200 entries.

  The effect was backwards from what you want: a frequently-matching trigger
  starved the quiet ones, and quiet triggers are exactly what you arm to catch
  something rare. Observed in practice with the built-in `l>=ERROR` trigger
  firing throughout a 70-minute test run while a trigger armed for a rare event
  recorded zero matches, with matching entries confirmed in the buffer.

  Firing suppression is now **per trigger**: each debounces only itself. The
  session-level counter is unchanged and still governs storage (capture context
  after a fire, bypassing filters).

- **A short `post_window` no longer truncates a longer one already in flight.**
  Now that a match can land inside an open window, the storage window extends
  rather than being overwritten.

- **`edit` applies to a window already in flight.** Shrinking `post_window` —
  notably to `0`, the documented way to ask for "count every match" — took
  effect only after the old window drained, which on a quiet stream could be
  indefinitely. Changing a trigger's *filter* now also re-arms it immediately.

- **Rebinding a session to another domain clears in-flight debounce windows**,
  completing the existing F3 invariant for firing as well as storage.

- **Span triggers now count their matches.** A span trigger's `match_count`
  stayed `0` forever, so "has this ever fired?" was unanswerable.

### Added

- **`post_remaining` on `TriggerInfo`** (`triggers.list` and `triggers.edit`;
  `triggers.add` returns only the new id, as before):
  entries still to pass before a trigger can fire again; `0` means armed and
  live. If a trigger looks stuck, this distinguishes "debounced" from "broken".
  Additive and defaulted, so older clients are unaffected.

### Changed

- **Expect more notifications** in sessions with several triggers, and
  `match_count` to start moving on triggers that previously read `0` for their
  entire lifetime. Those fires were being silently dropped; the new numbers are
  the corrected ones, not a regression.
- **Expect your filters to be bypassed more often.** The storage post-window
  is re-armed by any trigger firing, and triggers now fire that previously
  could not, so more entries are stored unconditionally as post-trigger
  context. Bounded — the window still closes within `max(post_window)` entries
  of the last fire, and the store is a fixed-size ring — but in a session with
  several frequently-matching triggers it can stay open continuously.
- **A firing entry is far more expensive than a normal one** (~200 µs vs
  ~0.6 µs at `pre_window: 500`: a store scan plus context clones). That cost
  was previously rate-limited to once per `post_window` entries per session;
  per-trigger debouncing makes it reachable per trigger. An undebounced
  (`post_window: 0`) trigger on a busy stream can bottleneck that domain's
  processor — see the README's note before using it.

### Notes

- Span triggers still fire on **every** matching span and are never debounced,
  so their `post_remaining` is always `0` and carries no information. Unifying
  the log and span evaluation paths is deferred: span triggers always fire, so
  the gap costs extra notifications rather than silent misses.
- Documentation for `matched_filters` was corrected. It is populated only when
  `source == Filter`; an entry stored because a trigger fired (`PreTrigger` /
  `PostTrigger`) matched no filter, so an empty value there is correct. Read it
  together with `source`, never alone.
